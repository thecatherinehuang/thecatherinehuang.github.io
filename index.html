<p>Hi there! My name is Catherine. I'm a junior studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley. My interests lie in the intersection between machine learning, theoretical computer science, and probability.</p>
<p>This summer, I attended a REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) at ICERM and worked with so many incredible people, special shout out to my group and mentors! I learned a lot of math, how to make sick Beamer presentations, and about the process of writing a paper. But most important of all, after countless weeks of headbanging and doubt, I emerged from the program confident in my ability to learn anything given the time and the Internet. Check out our project <a href="https://ghost-clusters.github.io/icerm-spectral-clustering/">website</a> for details. 
<!-- <p>Riding this wave of confidence, I have since learned how to create websites and am currently diving deeper into analysis and machine learning.</p> -->
<!-- <p>I enjoy teaching and content creation. I'll be teaching Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory (CS 70) and reading for Probability and Random Processes (EECS 126) this year!</p> -->
<p>I also picked up bread making as a quarantine hobby. It brings me back to pre-covid times where my roommate and I would make our way to Cheeseboard, buy a giant loaf of sourdough, slather it with some softened garlic butter, and be completely content. </p>
<p>Just recently I started running. I don't like it (at all). Nevertheless, I'm determined to run a half-marathon once quarantine ends.</p>
